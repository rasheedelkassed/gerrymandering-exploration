      <p>
        In 1812, the state of Massachusetts was forced to adopt the idea of electoral district boundaries.
        <br />
        <br />
        Funnily enough, also in 1812, the state governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry, signed a bill that drew the
        newly required
        electoral districts of Massachusetts in a way that favored his Democratic-Republican Party.
        <br />
        <br />
        The new districts proved to be a huge success for the Democratic-Republican Party, helping secure the majority
        of control in the state's senate. What really sucks is that despite Elbridge Gerry sharing his disapproval of
        the underhanded tactic,
        he nevertheless became the namesake of what we now call <b><em>Gerrymandering</em></b>.
        <br />
        <br />
        This, however, begs the question: <b>How exactly does just drawing some borders on a map influence anything, let
          alone an election?</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        I think looking at pictures and diagrams is great and all, but I don't think it really sells it well enough.
        There is only one thing I think can really clear this up...

      <p>
        We are about to display a hypothetical state in front of you that you have to draw the electoral districts for.
        In this case, it's being
        represented by a collection of squares on a grid where each square represents a neighborhood.
        <b>Here are the rules:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Click & Drag to draw a district.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Click an existing district to delete it.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Each district must contain exactly <b>FIVE CONTINUOUS</b> squares.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Each district elects a representative on a simple majority system, meaning that a district with 3 Orange and 2
        Purple neighborhoods elects an Orange sided representative.

        Let's start by trying to apply those rules that were just sort of thrown at you!
        <br />
        <br />
        Here we have a small state with five neighborhoods (square with a house on it).
        Remember that each district requires five neighborhoods, which implies that this state only has one district:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Click & drag to draw the single possible district for this state</b> (There is also a button that does this
        for you in the bottom left):

      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        That was fairly simple. Our fake state is not large enough to warrant multiple districts, so no manipulation by
        border drawing here.
        <br />
        What happens if we go just a tiny bit bigger?

        We've got a bigger state for you to draw borders for! There looks to be 10 neighborhoods this time, so go ahead
        and draw its two districts.

        Nothing about that state changed, but we were still able to cause three <b>totally different results</b>, two of
        which could be considered unfair.
        <br />
        <br />
        How could that be?
        <br />
        <br />
        The reason this is possible is due to something known as the <em>wasted vote effect</em>. If a district is split
        3:2, it seems as though the 2 votes that were cast did not contribute towards electing any sort of
        representative and were completely wasted!
      </p>
      <div>
        <img src="sprites/wasted_vote_effect.png" />
      </div>
      <p>
        We can use this fact to dilute one parties voters over several districts, thus diminishing their voting power.
        Purposefully taking advantage of the wasted vote effect in this way is called <em>cracking</em>.

        Here we have a state that favors Orange 3 to 2 (15 Orange neighborhoods to 10 Purple ones). Instead of keeping
        the ratio of representative equal to the ratio of voters, I want you to give Orange full control of all
        <em>five</em> possible districts. In short:

        While cracking does a good job, it's not always possible to achieve 100% control of a state (in reality, it's
        pretty much impossible).
        <br />
        <br />
        To get around this, we can use a different method along with cracking called <b><em>packing</em></b>.
        <br />
        <br />
        Packing is the intentional stuffing of many votes in as concentrated a place as possible.

        It is clear that these methods of political influence change the democratic dynamic from people picking their
        representatives to representatives picking their people.
        Plain and simple, elections are no longer competitive if these systems exist.
        <br />
        <br />
        There are a number of systems that could be put in place to ensure a competitive elections. The first, and
        simplest, solution is to implement a neutral or cross-party agency responsible for drawing the districts.
        This agency would be selected from apolitcal individuals and would help ensure there was no political bias in
        the drawing of districts.
        On top of this, members of this agency would be denied information such as voting patterns to ensure any biases
        are unable to show themselves in any meaningful way.

        <br />

        There really is a whole host of possible solutions to this problem:

        <br />
