        In 1812, the state of Massachusetts was forced to adopt the idea of electoral district boundaries.
        <br />
        <br />
        Also in 1812, the state governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry, signed a bill that drew the newly required
        electoral districts of Massachusetts in a way that favored his Democratic-Republican Party
        <br />
        <br />
        The new districts proved to be a huge success for the Democratic-Republican Party, helping secure the majority
        of control in the state's senate. Funnily enough, our man Gerry ended up losing his job due to the over-whelming
        support for the Federalist party.
        <br />
        <br />
        This begs the question: <b>How exactly does just drawing some borders influence an election?</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        I think looking at pictures and diagrams is great and all, but I don't think it really sells it well enough.
        There is only one thing I think can really clear this up:

      <p>
        You have a state in front of you that you have to draw the electoral districts for. In this case, it's being
        represented by a collection of neighborhoods on a square grid.
        <b>Here are the rules:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Click & Drag to draw a district.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Click an existing district to delete it.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Each district must contain exactly <b>FIVE CONTINUOUS</b> squares.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Each district elects a representative on a simple majority system, meaning that a district with 3 Orange and 2
        Purple neighborhoods elects an Orange sided representative.

        Let's try applying those rules!
        <br />
        <br />
        To start with here's a small state with five neighborhoods.
        Remember that each district requires five neighborhoods, which implies that this state only has one district:

        Let's get <em>slightly</em> more complicated. In this state, we have the ability to draw two districts in
        various
        formations:

        Here we have an ever so slightly bigger state, a state where we are finally able to influence how many districts
        each political party wins.
