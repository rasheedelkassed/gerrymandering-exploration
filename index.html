  <h1>It's Not Arbitrary</h1>
  <h2>An explanation of the unexplanable electoral boundaries</h2>
  <p>You've just been tasked with drawing the electoral boundaries for an entire state of the GSA, better known as The Grided States of America.</p>
  <p>In an attempt to provide proper representation of the general population, the GSA divides its states with the usage of electoral districts. These districts are then given a representative with a political affiliation that matches the winning majority of the district. The number and size of the districts that a state gets are determined by their population.</p>
  <p>Each state consists of a several square neighborhoods which follow one of the two main political parties: Purple or Yellow, and it's your job to draw the electoral boundaries such that there is a proper amount of representation.</p>
