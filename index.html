      <p>
        In 1812, the state of Massachusetts was forced to adopt the idea of electoral district boundaries.
        <br />
        <br />
        Funnily enough, also in 1812, the state governor of Massachusetts, Elbridge Gerry, signed a bill that drew the newly required
        electoral districts of Massachusetts in a way that favored his Democratic-Republican Party.
        <br />
        <br />
        The new districts proved to be a huge success for the Democratic-Republican Party, helping secure the majority
        of control in the state's senate. What really sucks is that despite Elbridge Gerry sharing his disapproval of the underhanded tactic,
        he nevertheless became the namesake of what we now call <b><em>Gerrymandering</em></b>.
        <br />
        <br />
        This, however, begs the question: <b>How exactly does just drawing some borders on a map influence anything, let alone an election?</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        I think looking at pictures and diagrams is great and all, but I don't think it really sells it well enough.
        There is only one thing I think can really clear this up...

      <p>
        We are about to display a hypothetical state in front of you that you have to draw the electoral districts for. In this case, it's being
        represented by a collection of squares on a grid where each square represents a neighborhood.
        <b>Here are the rules:</b>
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Click & Drag to draw a district.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Click an existing district to delete it.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Each district must contain exactly <b>FIVE CONTINUOUS</b> squares.
        <br />
        <br />
        ◘ Each district elects a representative on a simple majority system, meaning that a district with 3 Orange and 2
        Purple neighborhoods elects an Orange sided representative.

        Let's start by trying to apply those rules that were just sort of thrown at you!
        <br />
        <br />
        Here we have a small state with five neighborhoods (square with a house on it).
        Remember that each district requires five neighborhoods, which implies that this state only has one district:
        <br />
        <br />
        <b>Click & drag to draw the single possible district for this state</b> (There is also a button that does this for you in the bottom left):

      </div>
      <br />
      <p>
        That was fairly simple. Our fake state is not large enough to warrant multiple districts, so no manipulation by border drawing here.
        <br />
        What happens if we go just a tiny bit bigger?

        We've got a bigger state for you to draw borders for! There looks to be 10 neighborhoods this time, so go ahead and draw its two districts.
        <br />
        <br />

        You might notice that despite increasing in size, we still can't really change how many of each color's representative gets elected.

        It seems as though we need to...

        This is more like it! We've now got a total of 15 neighborhoods to play around with which means we can draw a total of three districts!
        <br />
        <br />

        With the semi-logical three rows of districts, we see a set of districts that look pretty normal. Now using the same "state":

        Having Orange win everything means that Purple didn't get any representation. Let's now have it so purple gets too much representation:

        What we just did there is take advantage of something called the <em>wasted vote</em>. 
        When we draw a district and designate one color as the winner, this, in a way, causes the other color to "waste" their votes in that district.
        The votes aren't <em>literally</em> wasted, but they fail to contribute to a winning color.
        <br />
        <br />
        Let's go bigger with our fake state so this idea becomes even more obvious.

      Take the following state, for example. Depending on how the districts are drawn you can either have either Orange
      or Purple when two districts.
